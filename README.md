# voxel-engine

This is an exprimental fork/branch of voxel-engine#ndarray.
It attempts to impose some structure on the engine by 
splitting key areas of functionality into submodules. 

The motivtation is to prevent game plugins from tightly coupling 
with lower-level dependencies, by imposing interfaces between them.

Very early stages for the moment.
